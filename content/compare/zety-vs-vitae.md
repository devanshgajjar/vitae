# Zety vs Vitae

## TL;DR
If you’re tired of $20/mo resume subscriptions, Vitae is a micro-priced, ATS-first alternative: $1/mo for 1 profile or $3/mo for 5. Users often report Zety’s templates are polished but can be heavy and not ATS-optimized by default. Vitae focuses on JD-tailoring in minutes, clean parsing, and export-ready formats. It’s currently free for the first 20 users.
