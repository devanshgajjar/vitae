- Who it’s for: job seekers who want ATS‑safe resumes, quick JD tailoring, transparent $1/$3 pricing; non‑native English writers.
- Who it’s not for: users who want highly designed, graphic‑heavy templates over ATS reliability.

  - Some templates risk ATS parsing issues
  - Time‑consuming tailoring for each JD

See “Sources” for references.

## How we tested / methodology
- ATS parsing: headed sections, single‑column layout, bullet/text fidelity
- Customization speed: time from JD paste → tailored bullets
- Pricing transparency: full monthly cost, cancellation clarity
- Export formats: PDF/DOCX and any restrictions
- Non‑native support: clarity of copy helpers, tone guides

## Hands‑on walkthrough (Vitae)
1) Paste the job description  
2) Select your profile → Vitae highlights keyword gaps  
3) Accept suggested bullet rewrites and summary tweaks  
4) Run ATS checks (headings, bullets, dates, links)  
5) Export PDF/DOCX/MD
