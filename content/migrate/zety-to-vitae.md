## Pre‑flight checklist (recommended)

| Check | Action |
|---|---|
| File type | Export DOCX from Zety |
| Headings | Use standard sections (Summary, Experience, Education, Skills) |
| Layout | Prefer single‑column for ATS |
| Bullets | Replace icons with text bullets |
| Dates/Links | Verify YYYY–MM and working links |

## 5‑step migration

1) Export from Zety → DOCX  
2) Import to Vitae (Create → Import)  
3) Resolve ATS warnings (headings, icons, spacing)  
4) Paste JD → accept tailored bullet and summary suggestions  
5) Export PDF/DOCX/MD

### Common pitfalls
- Two‑column or graphic icons: convert to text for ATS.  
- Dense paragraphs: break into bullets with measurable results.  
- Date ranges: normalize formatting (e.g., Jan 2023–Present).

## Troubleshooting
- Formatting loss on import: use DOCX (not PDF), and simplify styles.  
- Bullets render oddly: switch to standard text bullets.  
- Links broken: re‑add as plain URLs.

## Alternatives
- Canva → best for design; verify ATS output after export.  
- Jobscan → dedicated ATS keyword checking.  
- Rezi / Teal → keywording and role targeting.

## FAQ
1) How long does migration take? Typically 5–10 minutes.  
2) Is it free? Free for the first 20 users; then $1/$3 monthly.  
3) Will my resume be ATS‑safe? Yes—Vitae flags and helps fix parsing issues.  
4) Can I keep multiple versions? Yes—profiles + documents.  
5) Exports? PDF, DOCX, MD.
