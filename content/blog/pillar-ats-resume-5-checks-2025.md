## Quick checklist

| Check | Pass? |
|---|---|
| Standard headings (Summary, Experience, Education, Skills) | ☐ |
| Single‑column, text‑first layout | ☐ |
| JD keywords mirrored naturally | ☐ |

| Consistent dates and clean bullets | ☐ |

## The five checks (2025)

1) Structure: single‑column, text‑first; avoid text in images.  
2) Headings: use standard section names so parsers recognize them.  
3) Keywords: mirror the JD, but keep sentences human and honest.  
4) File/type: export PDF or DOCX as the portal requests.  
5) Formatting: consistent bullets, dates, spacing, and link hygiene.

Vitae enforces ATS‑first defaults and suggests JD‑aligned bullet rewrites in minutes.

## Methodology (how we evaluate)
- Parsed multiple resumes with known ATS rulesets
- Compared single vs multi‑column outcomes
- Timed JD tailoring from paste → export
