# ATS Resume: The 5 Checks You Need in 2025

## TL;DR
Most rejections happen before a human sees your resume. These five ATS checks—clean structure, scannable headings, keyword alignment, file compatibility, and consistent formatting—make the difference. Vitae helps you run these checks and tailor to any JD in minutes. $1/mo (1 profile) or $3/mo (5 profiles). Free for the first 20 users.

## FAQ
1. Does ATS hate graphics? Excessive graphics can fail parsing; keep it simple.
2. Should I submit PDF or DOCX? Check JD/portal; Vitae exports both.
3. How do I add keywords? Use the JD-tailoring flow.
4. Pricing? $1/$3; free for first 20 users.
